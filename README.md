# NFL Kaggle Project Description

This project is based on Kaggle's ["NFL Big Data Bowl 2025"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2025).

## Project Description from Kaggle
The National Football League (NFL) is back with another Big Data Bowl, where contestants use Next Gen Stats player tracking data to generate actionable, creative, and novel stats. Previous iterations have analyzed running backs, defensive backs, special teams, pass rush plays, and tackling, and have generated metrics that have been used on television and by NFL teams.

### NFL_Home_Advantage_Test.ipynb
I wanted to see if in the NFL there was a significant advantage of having the home court. I ran a A/B test to see if a could get a P-Value of under .05 and conclude if there was a significant Advantage of being at home.

### NFL_Players.ipynb
I decided to see if having more passing yards on a team resulted in a higher point differential. I looked at specific QB's and saw if they threw more yard would they win by more or loss by less. With this I created a linear regression model to predict the score differential of a game based on the amount of passing yards in the game inputed.
